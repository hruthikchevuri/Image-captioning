# Image-captioning

This report briefly describes and summarizes our mini project image captioning.
We have designed a CNN-LSTM system for generating captions for images. This
report contains our approach towards the model, BLEU score evaluation on the
test dataset and the captions that are genearated for the given subjective images
by our model .<br />

We have used Flickr8 dataset to train our neural network. This drive contains the dataset :- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RQ5qHm0aVFqWDG9VBiSnXlNPl5T15Wf_?usp=sharing
